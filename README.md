## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on APP functionality and APP design.

### The challenge

Challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and make it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

## My process

- Create initial project using React JS.
- Create APP header – title and color changer.
- Create user search bar – scope logo, input placeholder, search button.
- Create results display top section – picture, name, @name, registration date.
- Create user bio section.
- Create user repositories and followers section.
- Create location and links section.
- Add color theme changer function.
- Add Github API connection to the APP, for searching users.

### Built with

- React JS
- Node JS
- Github API
- Mobile first approach
- GitFlow workflow
- React styled components

### What I learned

While working on this project, the main challenge that I overcame was to create React Js Functionality for the APP. After research and practicing different ways for resolving necessary steps, I wrote the code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making APPs interactive, dynamic and functional.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing APPs to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects.
